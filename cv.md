## About me

I am 25 years old and work as an engineer in a strategic ice cream factory. In my free time, I lead an active lifestyle: rock climbing, running, hiking and trekking.

I decided to try myself in front-end development, because I like to create something new and useful, I think that everything will work out for me.
